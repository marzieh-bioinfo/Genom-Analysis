# Genom-Analysis

This repository contains my bioinformatics workflows for genome and transcriptome analysis.

## Project overview
- Genome assembly and polishing from sequencing data
- Quality control (FastQC, MultiQC)
- Genome comparison and functional annotation
- (If relevant) RNA-seq / differential expression analysis

## Tools and technologies
- Programming: Python, Bash, R
- HPC: UPPMAX (Rackham, Slurm)
- Software: Flye, Pilon, Prokka, eggNOG-mapper, QUAST, BUSCO, MUMmer, DESeq2

## Repository structure
- `code/` – scripts and pipelines used in the analysis
- `author/` – author / project-related information
- `out/` – selected output files and results (no raw data)

## Status
This project is part of my Bioinformatics MSc work and will be updated as I refine the analysis.
